# MPU6050
Learning how to orient machines  

Status
- Getting correct angles with accel
- Getting values from gyro which change as per movement
- However, when using that weird algo OR when just integrating for getting angles. It goes berserk. Just keeps adding.

Still don't understand Yaw correction.
